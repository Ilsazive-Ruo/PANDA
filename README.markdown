##Task Definitions
This repository includes multiple prediction tasks aligned with those described in the associated publication. The tasks and their corresponding labels in the code are as follows:

- **SYN and PV**:
Correspond to the Pharmacological Prediction tasks, referred to as the PP set in the paper.
- **SA**:
Refers to the APIâ€“Excipient Design task.
- **FSA**:
Refers to the Manufacturing Optimization task.

## Usage
Explain how to run the code, including examples:

- **Training**:
  ```bash
  python train.py  -b batchsize -e epochs
  ```
- **Evaluation**:
  ```bash
  python CV.py  -b batchsize -e epochs
  ```
- **Prediction with demo data**:
  ```bash
  python predictor.py -i data/demo.csv -p predicted -m weights/PANDA.pth -t SA
  ```
